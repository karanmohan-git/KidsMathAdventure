# Kids Code & Math Academy

![Kids Code & Math Academy](./attached_assets/logo.png)

## üìö Project Overview

Kids Code & Math Academy is an interactive educational web application designed specifically for children ages 6-8. The platform combines coding and mathematics education through engaging, age-appropriate activities across three core learning modules:

1. **Python Programming** - Introduces basic coding concepts through a simplified Python editor with visual outputs
2. **Algebra** - Teaches fundamental algebraic concepts through interactive problem-solving with instant feedback
3. **Geometry** - Explores shapes, angles, and spatial reasoning through dynamic visual demonstrations

## üöÄ Features

- **Child-friendly UI** - Large buttons, vibrant colors, and intuitive navigation designed for young learners
- **Interactive Learning Modules**:
  - **Python Coding**: In-browser Python code execution with visual output
  - **Algebra**: Adaptive problem difficulty with step-by-step explanations
  - **Geometry**: Interactive shape explorer with dynamic property calculations
- **Gamified Learning** - Progress tracking, challenges, and achievements to maintain engagement
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktops, tablets, and larger mobile devices

## üñ•Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: TailwindCSS with ShadCN UI components
- **State Management**: React Hooks and Context API
- **Server**: Express.js backend
- **Python Execution**: Pyodide (WebAssembly-based Python runtime)
- **Visualization**: SVG for geometry, custom visualization for Python output
- **Development**: Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
